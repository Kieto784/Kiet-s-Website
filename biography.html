            Well, I lived there until I was roughly 8 before moving to America.
            During that time I did go to kindergarden and remember very faint
            experiences of then. I grew up speaking Chinese (Cantonese)
            along with Vietnamese.

          <p>
            I moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania and started the school in the firstgrade roughly
            around end of Fall. I really did not understand the English language at all during
            that year but I feel like I was still able to get by communicating with simple
            phrases/terms.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I remember being in ELL (English Language Learning) classes for the majority of my
            time there where I was able to meet a few others like me who did not speak any English
            at all.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I still found it fun being able to spend time with new friends!

          <p>
            I was in Pennsylvania near the beginning of Winter and I've never experienced anything
            like this sort of weather. I was astonished by snow and especially how much it snowed,
            I may have been very small at the time but I confidently want to say that it snowed
            more than a foot.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            My brother and I spent so many hours over one weekend playing outside in the snow and
            we became very sick for a week afterwards. I did not regret that experience, and I
            still enjoy Winter and snow very much to this day!

            Summer of 2011, I moved over to Renton Washington. I unfortunately could not find my
            3rd grade photos (which was the year I started school in Washington), so I used my 4th
            grade photo instead ðŸ˜­.

            I remember thinking that I would once again, have to learn a whole new langauge from
            scratch (not) knowing that the entire United States spoke English).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Anyways, I met two amazing friends from Highlands Elementary who I still am very
            close with to today, Sophia (who was the first person whom I've met with the same
            last name as I), and Felix (we shared the same enthusiam for Dragon Ball Z growing up).

          With each elevation in school from primary to intermediate, and secondary. There
          are some significant shifts in the environment for sure. From the more vast variety of
          sports and clubs to being able to leave campus for lunch, and the harder cirriculums of
          AP and IB where it can contribuite to your potential future. I was very excited for sure
          being able to choose more of the classes I like and also in meeting new people.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My name here was not wasted at all, I spent quite the amount of time exploring around
          extracirrular activities after school that were offered. I found myself joining many
          sports team as well as recreational clubs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I expecially enjoyed joining the track team, swim team, as well as ASC (Asian Student
          Coalition) club at Hazen. I even ran a club with some of my friends, swhich was
          extremely hard as well as fun!

            Four years, has never felt so long...........

          <p>
            Our Junoir and Senoir year was basically robbed from us, having to isolate for over a
            year and moving to online school was something that was never expected. However,
            complaints about then is for another story. I'm very glad to have made it out now and
            slowly moving on from that horrendous experience of online schooling.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            My friends and I have never been so excited to see each other once again and especially
            during the time leading up to our graduation. Lots of us have been deciding on our post
            high school plans and cannot wait to see it. Some of us are sad that this may be the
            last time that we see each other for a while. Overall, I also had mixed feelings of
            excitment as well sadness. But this was something that has to happen so it is ok!
