                        Swimming is something that I enjoy very much and has been a part of my life ever since Elementary school. I consistenly went swimming every summer and occasionally during the school year. I've joined a few clubs for swimming and have taken it competed during high school swim team.

                        During my first year at the UW, together with my friends; Breana and Josh, we have gone to the UW Pavilion Pool nearly everyday all of Fall Quarter to swim.

                        With Area 01 being right under where we live, my friends and I often go down there to check out the games and activities that are there. One of them being ping pong. I played tennis for quite a bit during high school and had some confidence starting ping pong. After a while, I found myself to be very enthusiastic about it and have spent countless hours playing against my friends.
